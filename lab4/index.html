		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenge of this lab is to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>We didn't really have any problems this lab.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Look at the tasks below to see our pseudocode. Here are some screenshots of the pseudocode we created:</p>
